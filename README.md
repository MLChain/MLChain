**2. Comprehensive model support**: 
  Seamless integration with hundreds of proprietary / open-source LLMs from dozens of inference providers and self-hosted solutions, covering GPT, Mistral, Llama3, and any OpenAI API-compatible models. A full list of supported model providers can be found [here](https://docs-mlchain.khulnasoft.com/getting-started/readme/model-providers).

**3. Prompt IDE**: 
  Intuitive interface for crafting prompts, comparing model performance, and adding additional features such as text-to-speech to a chat-based app. 

**4. RAG Pipeline**: 
  Extensive RAG capabilities that cover everything from document ingestion to retrieval, with out-of-box support for text extraction from PDFs, PPTs, and other common document formats.

**5. Agent capabilities**: 
  You can define agents based on LLM Function Calling or ReAct, and add pre-built or custom tools for the agent. Mlchain provides 50+ built-in tools for AI agents, such as Google Search, DALL·E, Stable Diffusion and WolframAlpha.

**6. LLMOps**: 
  Monitor and analyze application logs and performance over time. You could continuously improve prompts, datasets, and models based on production data and annotations.

**7. Backend-as-a-Service**: 
  All of Mlchain's offerings come with corresponding APIs, so you could effortlessly integrate Mlchain into your own business logic.

- **Cloud </br>**
We host a [Mlchain Cloud](https://mlchain.khulnasoft.com) service for anyone to try with zero setup. It provides all the capabilities of the self-deployed version, and includes 200 free GPT-4 calls in the sandbox plan.

- **Self-hosting Mlchain Community Edition</br>**
Quickly get Mlchain running in your environment with this [starter guide](#quick-start).
Use our [documentation](https://docs-mlchain.khulnasoft.com) for further references and more in-depth instructions.

- **Mlchain for enterprise / organizations</br>**
We provide additional enterprise-centric features. [Log your questions for us through this chatbot](https://mlchain.khulnasoft.com/chat/22L1zSxg6yW1cWQg) or [send us an email](mailto:business@mlchain.khulnasoft.com?subject=[GitHub]Business%20License%20Inquiry) to discuss enterprise needs. </br>
  > For startups and small businesses using AWS, check out [Mlchain Premium on AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-t22mebxzwjhu6) and deploy it to your own AWS VPC with one-click. It's an affordable AMI offering with the option to create apps with custom logo and branding.

## Quick start
> Before installing Mlchain, make sure your machine meets the following minimum system requirements:
> 
>- CPU >= 2 Core
>- RAM >= 4GB

</br>

The easiest way to start the Mlchain server is to run our [docker-compose.yml](docker/docker-compose.yaml) file. Before running the installation command, make sure that [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) are installed on your machine:

```bash
cd docker
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up -d
```

After running, you can access the Mlchain dashboard in your browser at [http://localhost/install](http://localhost/install) and start the initialization process.

> If you'd like to contribute to Mlchain or do additional development, refer to our [guide to deploying from source code](https://docs-mlchain.khulnasoft.com/getting-started/install-self-hosted/local-source-code)

## Next steps

If you need to customize the configuration, please refer to the comments in our [.env.example](docker/.env.example) file and update the corresponding values in your `.env` file. Additionally, you might need to make adjustments to the `docker-compose.yaml` file itself, such as changing image versions, port mappings, or volume mounts, based on your specific deployment environment and requirements. After making any changes, please re-run `docker-compose up -d`. You can find the full list of available environment variables [here](https://docs-mlchain.khulnasoft.com/getting-started/install-self-hosted/environments).

If you'd like to configure a highly-available setup, there are community-contributed [Helm Charts](https://helm.sh/) and YAML files which allow Mlchain to be deployed on Kubernetes.
